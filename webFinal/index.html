      <p>    My name is Ethan and I'm 14 years old an will turn 15 in late december. I've gone through many different hobbies in my life but the ones that stuck the most were gaming and talking to my friends. After school you can usually find me either on my computer playing something or talking to my friends over face time. often we play the games together. If i had to estimate, I would say I spend 4 of my 6 hours awake snd at home a day talking to my friends, 1 hour playing games by my self and 2 hour to shower and eat. I usually eat when I get home from school and that is all I eat all day. Because I don't excersize much I dont need that many calories to get through the day and because I don't eat much the lack of excersize doesn't cause me to gain much weight. I go tp lane tech but I'm in the academic center. I only have two classes where I am with highschoolers an dhose are the worst ones because I cant talk to anybody. in the ltac classes I would usually talk to my friends to pass the time. I always procrastinate and do my homework at lunch or in a class period where we dont have to do much work. I'm generally pretty lazy and avoid work at all costs.
