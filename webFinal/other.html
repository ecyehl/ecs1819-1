                 <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                 <p>If I'm not at school you can usually find me talking to my friends. I talk to them on both buses, to and from school as well as about 75% of the tme I spend at home. I go on a 3 mile run every day but that only takes up a little time. all Extra time I have I play skyrim. It is my favorite video game right now and I am pretty far into it. A lot of the time I talk to my friends and play video games at the same time. When I go to sleep I usually watch a little hulu which for me means king of the hill. Sometimes I play games with my friends however the only games we can play together get boring after a while so that doesnt take that long.</p>

                    <h1>Family</h1>
                    <p>I don't really like traveling. my family always wants to go traveling however, so I am forced to go along with it. I hate tourists so naturally I hate looking like one. Also they always want to go on tours that take away your freedom and force you to follow some guy. They like biking and I like that too however, They sometimes try to merge them together and go on biking tours and that ruins biking. My family were the people who forced me to go on a city run which I still do today. overall their are good and bad time with my family so it's not a big deal.</p>
